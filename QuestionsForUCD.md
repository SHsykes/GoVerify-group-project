When not to use the GDS Transport font

If your service is publicly available on a subdomain other than service.gov.uk, use an alternative typeface like Helvetica or Arial.

What typeface would you like to use?

From: https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk#if-your-service-isnt-on-govuk

While you can use the patterns, your site or service must not:

    identify itself as being part of GOV.UK
    use the crown or GOV.UK logotype in the header
    use the GDS Transport typeface
    suggest that it’s an official UK government website if it’s not

How would you like us to build the page header?

Would you like us to build any pages to link to from the two hyperlinks on the consent page?

From: https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/link_text

Also, I found out that having links named "here" is not considered accessible so will need to make the links more descriptive to help screen reader users and to avoid confusion.

Would you like us to add a heading and hint to the checkbox options?

From: https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/

I have grouped the two buttons on the consent page to fit in with the design system styling. Is this OK?

From: https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/

We will need an error message when users do not select consent checkboxes. How would you like us to word this?
