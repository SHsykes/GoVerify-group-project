When not to use the GDS Transport font

If your service is publicly available on a subdomain other than service.gov.uk, use an alternative typeface like Helvetica or Arial.

What typeface would you like to use?

2. 

From: https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk#if-your-service-isnt-on-govuk

While you can use the patterns, your site or service must not:

    identify itself as being part of GOV.UK
    use the crown or GOV.UK logotype in the header
    use the GDS Transport typeface
    suggest that it’s an official UK government website if it’s not

How would you like us to build the page header?

Would you like us to build any pages to link to from the two hyperlinks on the consent page?

From: https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/link_text

Also, I found out that having links named "here" is not considered accessible so will need to make the links more descriptive to help screen reader users and to avoid confusion.

4. 

From: https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/checkboxes/

Would you like us to add a heading and hint to the checkbox options?

5. 

From: https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/

I have grouped the two buttons on the consent page to fit in with the design system styling. Is this OK?

6. 

From: https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/

We will need an error message when users do not select consent checkboxes. How would you like us to word this?

7. From: https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/images/

What alt text would you like us to add to the images on the upload rules page?

8.

What details do we want to ask for when the users create an account? What alternative means of contact should we use for users without an email address? (e.g. for forgotten passwords)

9. 

On the upload your document page it seemed like we were doubling up with click below and then the file uploader also asking to drag & drop or browse so for the time being I have left this for you to advise.

Also we had a discussion around browse not being very semantic so would like UCD opinion.

10. 

What functionality would you like the View button on the Your Documents page to have? Currently it does nothing as we aren't sure what you would like to happen when it is clicked.
